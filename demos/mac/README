This folder contains supporting code and CodeWarrior Pro 4 project
files to build the FreeType demo programs ftlint and ftview for MacOS.

Building
To build these apps, you'll first need to build the FreeType library
(see config/mac). The applications get built in the demos/bin folder.

Notes
Since the Mac doesn't have the notion of argc/argv, we'll emulate
this: each file dropped onto the application will be translated
to a command line argument. Both ftlint and ftview take a ppem
value as their first command line argument: for the Mac version
this has been hard-coded into the source. Also: the additional
options for ftview cannot be set.

Have fun with FreeType on the Mac!
